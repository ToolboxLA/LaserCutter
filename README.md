# LaserCutter
Documentation for our Thunder Laser machine.

[Getting Started](GettingStarted.md)

## Help Wanted

Right now there isn't much in here, but there will be soon. The goal is to build this out into comprehensive documentation of every aspect of our laser cutter. That will allow us to:

* Share knowledge with each other
* Iterate to improve the current setup with cool things (e.g. autofocus? nitrogen?)
* Establish best practices for cutting, safety, and more
